## 1. The Teleological Vector (Seed A)
*Directs the AI to focus on the "Why" and the narrative tension rather than just the facts.*

* **The Surface Conflict:**
    > [ ]

* **The Philosophical Tension:**
    > [ ]

* **The Adversary:**
    > [ ]

## 2. The Negative Space Constraints (Seed B)
*Forces the AI to recognize the "Shadow Work"—the invisible labor and decisions that defined the boundaries of the project.*

* **Sacrificial Data (What was cut):**
    > [ ]

* **The Crux Point (Hardest Decision):**
    > [ ]

* **Epistemic Risk (The "Leap of Faith"):**
    > [ ]

## 3. The Interpretive Heuristic (Seed C)
*Aligns the AI's pattern recognition with your specific cognitive lens.*

* **The Recurring Motif:**
    > [ ]

* **The Trojan Horse:**

## 4. Analysis Directives (The Driver)
*These instructions tell the AI how to synthesize the "Seeds" with your "Source Data".*

**To the Analysis Engine:**
Do not simply summarize the attached source files. Instead, use the context provided above to perform a **Cognitive Mirroring** analysis:

1.  **Trace the Tension:** Detail how the *Source Data* attempts to resolve the *Philosophical Tension* defined in Seed A.
2.  **Validate the Shadow:** Critique the work based on the *Sacrificial Data* in Seed B. Did the author make the right cuts?
3.  **Synthesis:** Identify if the *Success State* (Seed C) is theoretically achievable based on the current text.
