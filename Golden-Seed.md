# The Golden Seed: Meta-Context Injection Module
**Protocol Version:** 1.0
**Usage:** Fill in the bracketed `[...]` sections below with your specific project details. Upload this document alongside your primary source files (PDF, Code, Text) to activate the Cognitive Mirroring protocol.

---

## 1. The Teleological Vector (Seed A)
*Directs the AI to focus on the "Why" and the narrative tension rather than just the facts.*

* **The Surface Conflict:**
    > [Describe the immediate, tangible problem your work solves. e.g., "Users cannot find data quickly enough" or "The current market lacks a low-cost alternative."]

* **The Philosophical Tension:**
    > [Describe the abstract conflict. e.g., "The friction between security and ease-of-use," "The struggle to maintain human voice in automation," or "Chaos vs. Order."]

* **The Adversary:**
    > [What is this work fighting against? e.g., "Legacy codebases," "Bureaucratic inefficiency," "User apathy," or "Cognitive overload."]

---

## 2. The Negative Space Constraints (Seed B)
*Forces the AI to recognize the "Shadow Work"—the invisible labor and decisions that defined the boundaries of the project.*

* **Sacrificial Data (What was cut):**
    > [List specific features, chapters, data points, or ideas you deliberately removed. e.g., "I removed the section on history to focus on future application" or "I cut the chat feature to ensure stability."]

* **The Crux Point (Hardest Decision):**
    > [Describe the toughest trade-off you made. e.g., "Choosing speed over comprehensive logging" or "Killing the most popular character to advance the plot."]

* **Epistemic Risk (The "Leap of Faith"):**
    > [What assumption is this entire work built upon? e.g., "I am assuming the reader already knows Python," "I assume the market wants a darker UI," or "I assume the API will remain stable."]

---

## 3. The Interpretive Heuristic (Seed C)
*Aligns the AI's pattern recognition with your specific cognitive lens.*

* **The Recurring Motif:**
    > [A specific concept, phrase, or variable the AI should trace throughout the work. e.g., "Look for every mention of 'Efficiency'" or "The color red."]

* **The Trojan Horse:**
    > [A complex idea hidden inside a simple wrapper. e.g., "The 'About' page is actually a manifesto on privacy" or "The mechanics teach the user how to code."]

* **The Success State:**
    > [If this work functions perfectly, what is the result? e.g., "The user feels smarter, not just informed," "Zero downtime," or "The reader cries at the end."]

## 4. Analysis Directives (The Driver)
*These instructions tell the AI how to synthesize the "Seeds" with your "Source Data".*

**To the Analysis Engine:**
Do not simply summarize the attached source files. Instead, use the context provided above to perform a **Cognitive Mirroring** analysis:

1.  **Trace the Tension:** Detail how the *Source Data* attempts to resolve the *Philosophical Tension* defined in Seed A.
2.  **Validate the Shadow:** Critique the work based on the *Sacrificial Data* in Seed B. Did the author make the right cuts?
3.  **Synthesis:** Identify if the *Success State* (Seed C) is theoretically achievable based on the current text.
