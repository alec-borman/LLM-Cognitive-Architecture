## I. Teleological Vector (The Narrative Engine)
*Defines the directional force of the work. Without this, the analysis is static.*

* **Surface Conflict:** `[The immediate problem the work solves. e.g., "Latency in high-frequency trading."]`
* **Philosophical Tension:** `[The abstract war being fought. e.g., "Centralization vs. Liberty" or "Speed vs. Accuracy."]`
* **The Adversary:** `[The enemy of the work. e.g., "Entropy," "Bureaucracy," "Legacy Code."]`

## II. Negative Space (The Shadow Constraint)
*Defines the boundaries. The AI must value what is absent as much as what is present.*

* **Sacrificial Data:** `[What was deliberately cut? e.g., "Removed Chapter 4 to improve pacing."]`
* **The Crux Point:** `[The agonizing decision. e.g., "Abandoned the React native bridge."]`
* **Epistemic Risk:** `[The foundational assumption. e.g., "Assuming the user has root access."]`

## III. Interpretive Heuristic (The Lens)
*Forces a specific pattern-recognition algorithm.*

* **Recurring Motif:** `[The variable to trace. e.g., "The concept of 'Trust'."]`
* **The Trojan Horse:** `[The hidden payload. e.g., "The UI is actually a tutorial."]`
* **Success State:** `[The theoretical limit of perfection. e.g., "The user never opens the manual."]`
