### Phase 1: The Golden Seed (Filled)

Here is the populated meta-context for the Salesforce Architect domain.

## 1\. The Teleological Vector (Seed A)

  * **The Surface Conflict:**

    > [Speed of Delivery (Business Agility) vs. System Stability (Technical Governance)]

  * **The Philosophical Tension:**

    > [The "Click-Not-Code" Dogma vs. The Reality of Complex Logic (Declarative Rigidity vs. Programmatic Freedom)]

  * **The Adversary:**

    > [Technical Debt (specifically: Entropy caused by unmanaged dependencies and poor separation of concerns)]

## 2\. The Negative Space Constraints (Seed B)

  * **Sacrificial Data (What was cut):**

    > [Basic syntax, standard admin setup steps, marketing cloud/peripheral tool features, and rote memorization of simple governor limits (things easily Googled).]

  * **The Crux Point (Hardest Decision):**

    > [The "Buy vs. Build" and "Single-Org vs. Multi-Org" Strategy. Deciding when to *stop* using Salesforce for a specific task.]

  * **Epistemic Risk (The "Leap of Faith"):**

    > [The assumption that the current data model will support 10x volume growth without refactoring.]

## 3\. The Interpretive Heuristic (Seed C)

  * **The Recurring Motif:**

    > [Governor Limits as Design Constraints (Thinking in batches, bulkification, and asynchronous processing).]

  * **The Trojan Horse:**

    > [Scalability (Designing for the 1 millionth record while building the 1st).]

  * **The Success State:**

    > [A system that requires minimal refactoring during business scaling events; "Boring" operations.]
