# Sample Seed: The Bitcoin Protocol
**Source:** "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"
**Author Intent:** S. Nakamoto

## I. Teleological Vector
* **Surface Conflict:** Commerce relies on trusted third parties (Banks).
* **Philosophical Tension:** Trust vs. Cryptographic Proof.
* **The Adversary:** The "Double-Spend" problem and Centralized Mediation.

## II. Negative Space
* **Sacrificial Data:** Transaction Reversibility. (Sacrificed consumer protection for merchant security).
* **The Crux Point:** One-CPU-one-vote (Proof of Work) instead of One-IP-one-vote.
* **Epistemic Risk:** The "51% Assumption" (Honest nodes control the majority of CPU power).

## III. Interpretive Heuristic
* **Recurring Motif:** "The Chain." (The longest chain is the only truth).
* **Success State:** A system where trust is obsolete.
