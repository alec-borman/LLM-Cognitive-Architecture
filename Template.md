## 1. The Teleological Vector (Seed A)
*Directs the AI to focus on the "Why" and the narrative tension rather than just the facts.*

* **The Surface Conflict:**
    > [Describe the immediate, tangible problem your work solves. e.g., "Users cannot find data quickly enough."]

* **The Philosophical Tension:**
    > [Describe the abstract conflict. e.g., "The friction between security and ease-of-use," or "The struggle to maintain human voice in automation."]

* **The Adversary:**
    > [What is this work fighting against? e.g., "Legacy codebases," "User apathy," "Cognitive overload."]

---

## 2. The Negative Space Constraints (Seed B)
*Forces the AI to recognize the "Shadow Work"—the invisible labor and decisions that defined the boundaries of the project.*

* **Sacrificial Data (What was cut):**
    > [List specific features, chapters, or ideas you deliberately removed. e.g., "I removed the section on history to focus on future application."]

* **The Crux Point (Hardest Decision):**
    > [Describe the toughest trade-off you made. e.g., "Choosing speed over comprehensive logging."]

* **Epistemic Risk (The "Leap of Faith"):**
    > [What assumption is this entire work built upon? e.g., "I am assuming the reader already knows Python," or "I assume the market wants a darker UI."]

---

## 3. The Interpretive Heuristic (Seed C)
*Aligns the AI's pattern recognition with your specific cognitive lens.*

* **The Recurring Motif:**
    > [A specific concept or phrase the AI should trace throughout the work. e.g., "Look for every mention of 'Efficiency'."]

* **The Trojan Horse:**
    > [A complex idea hidden inside a simple wrapper. e.g., "The 'About' page is actually a manifesto on privacy."]

* **The Success State:**
    > [If this work functions perfectly, what is the result? e.g., "The user feels smarter, not just informed."]

## 4. Analysis Directives (The Driver)
*These instructions tell the AI how to synthesize the "Seeds" with your "Source Data".*

**To the Analysis Engine:**
Do not simply summarize the attached source files. Instead, use the context provided above to perform a **Cognitive Mirroring** analysis:

1.  **Trace the Tension:** detailed how the *Source Data* attempts to resolve the *Philosophical Tension* defined in Seed A.
2.  **Validate the Shadow:** Critique the work based on the *Sacrificial Data* in Seed B. Did the author make the right cuts?
3.  **Synthesis:** Identify if the *Success State* (Seed C) is theoretically achievable based on the current text.
